# runcool
A simple web app for what to wear on a run based on the weather, time of day, and type of run.

The tool is based on the concept & data from Runner's World [What to Wear](https://www.runnersworld.com/what-to-wear) tool but computes the time of day and weather conditions for you and features a simple UI.
